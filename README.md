# archiveorg-book-download
Automation of downloading pages of only-borrow books from archive.org using selenium webdriver and TestNG

AS OF NOW THE CODE DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE ARCHIVE.ORG IS NOT ALLOWING RIGHT CLICKING BORROWED BOOKS. I WILL TRY TO FIND A WORKAROUND SOON.

This project is done using POM. But I also made a normal version (src/test/java/tests/DownloadBook.java) in case you 
want to copy-paste it without trying to figure out which object belongs where. You have to add your username and password under configuration.properties.
If you are not using the POM version go to line 40 in DownloadBook.java class and add your username and password.
